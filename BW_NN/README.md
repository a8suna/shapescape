The BW_NN directory contains a feedforward neural network trained to recognise black and white from black or white images that will be used to build a prototype neural network VR visualisation tool in Unity. The Jupyter Notebook BlackWhiteNN.ipynb details the custom data loading, building, training and testing of the neural network using PyTorch, which is saved as BW_model.pth. 

bwImages contains the black and white images used to train and test the neural network, and labels.csv contains labels for each of the images.
